# Why Trust?

- Social trust as a driver of many important outcome variables

  - .cyan[individual level]: well being and life satisfaction, physical health, voluntary work, participation in politics and community organizations, tolerance towards minority views, ... <font size="3"> <br>(cf. Carl and Billari 2014, Helliwell and Wang 2011; Bekkers 2012, Putnam 2000) </font size> 

  - .cyan[societal level]: improved performance and efficiency of public institutions, economic advantage and growth, informal social exchange, ... <font size="3"><br> (cf. LaPorta et al. 1997, Putnam 1992, Algan & Cahuc 2010, Bjørnskov 2012, Fukuyama 1995, Knack & Keefer 1997)</font size>

- .cyan[Why?] trust in others reduces “transaction costs”

--

- $\rightarrow$  social scientists aiming at understanding and explaining large and complex societies need to measure trust

---

# Background: Generalized Trust in Surveys 

- "most people"-trust Question:

<blockquote>“Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people?”</blockquote>
  
- General Social Survey (GSS), World Values Survey (WVS), European Social Survey (ESS), American National Election Studies (ANES)

.cyan[Critique:]
- vague question wording: “most people” or “being careful” have  a  different  meaning  for  different  respondents

- unspecific wording leads to measurement inequivalence $\rightarrow$ incomparability of individual answers 

---
# Background: Generalized Trust in Surveys

.cyan[Solutions?] 
- .cyan[asking for specific strangers and specific matters!]
- new measures that are based on a clear conception of trust:
  - previously: trust as a one-part relationship; .cyan[A trusts] (e.g., most people question) 
  - new: trust as a three-part relationship; .cyan[A trusts B to do X] 

- “milestone”: .cyan[Imaginary Stranger Trust (IST) scale (Robbins 2019, 2020)]
  - new measures of generalized trust for .cyan[trust towards a total stranger in] a series of .cyan[four different situations]

---

# Research Questions

- .cyan[(1) Are **standard measures of generalized trust** valid measures?]
<font size="3"> 
  - Generally speaking, would you say that .gold[most people] can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with people? (*most people*)
  
  - How much do you trust .gold[people you meet for the first time]? (*people first time*)
  
  - Imagine meeting a .gold[total stranger for the first time]. Please identify how much you would trust this stranger. (*stranger first time*) 
    
</font>
    
- .cyan[(2) Does asking for a variety of **situative trust measures** rather than a single-item trust measure increase validity?] <font size="3"> 

  - Imagine meeting a .gold[total stranger for the first time]. Please identify how much you would trust this stranger for each of the following: (*stranger situations 1-7*)
      - To keep a secret that is damaging to your reputation? (Robbins 2019)
      - To repay a loan of one thousand dollars? (Robbins 2019)
      - To look after a child, family member, or loved one while you are away? (Robbins 2019)
      - To provide advice about how best to manage your money? (Robbins 2019)
      - To watch your bags in an airport while you’re going to the bathroom?
      - To return you a lost wallet or purse?
      - To help you change a flat tire on your passenger car?  
  
</font>

# Data Collection

- online, self-administered questionnaire

- two stages analogue to our research questions (established measures vs. new situative measures)
- overall 12 questions per respondent
  - 10 substantial questions <font size="3"> 
      - most people</font> <font size="3"> 
      - people first time </font> <font size="3"> 
      - total stranger first time </font> <font size="3"> 
      - total stranger situations 1-7 </font>
  - 2 probing questions (written or audio format)<font size="3"> $\rightarrow$ to elicit associations with single questions
      - In answering the last question, what came to your mind? There are no right or wrong answers. We just want you to tell us everything that came to your mind as you answered the question.</font><font size="3"> 
      - Please describe what you associate with the term “most people/ people you meet for the first time / total stranger you meet for the first time" (in the last question). 
</font>

# Experimental Procedure

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='Fig. 1: Experimental Procedure. Order of single items within each stage are randomized.'}

knitr::include_graphics("experimental_procedure.png")
```

---
# Methodological Approach

.pull-left[
- .cyan[topic modeling] <br> = refers to the task of identifying categories (i.e., topics) within textual data (e.g., tweets, open-ended survey answers)

- .cyan[latent dirichlet allocation (LDA)] <br> = one popular topic modeling technique; .cyan[goal]: to assign each text as a mixture over a fixed number of latent topics
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='Fig. 2: cf. Blei (2003); each color codes a different topic'}
knitr::include_graphics("topic-models-Blei.png")
```
]


---
# Methodological Approach

- Our data will be data retrieved from the probing questions (textual and transcripted audio)

- $\rightarrow$ .cyan[**lower number of topics** (and a narrower thematic range of topics)] $\rightarrow$ lower variation of associations with a particular measure $\rightarrow$ points to an .cyan[increased level of validity]

---
# Hypotheses

  - H1a / H1b / H1c: Classifying respondents’ associations regarding .cyan[Measure 1 (“most people”) / Measure 2 (“people first time”)  / Measure 3 (“stranger first time”)] results in more than .cyan[6 topics]*.

<font size="3"> <br> *Sturgis & Smith 2010:<br>

      1. people one personally knows (e.g., acquaintances)<br>
      
      2. unknown others (people in general, strangers, etc.)<br>
      
      3. collectives of people (e.g., fellow citizens, neighbors, etc.)<br>
      
      4. specific groups of people (e.g. politicians, police, etc.)<br>
      
      5. associations of concrete situations and personal experiences rather than persons<br>
      
      6. associations that don't fit into any of those categories and answers like “don't know”
  </font>

---
# Hypotheses

  - H2: The .cyan[number of associated topics decreases] going from .cyan[Measure 1 (“most people”), over Measure 2 (“people first time”) to Measure 3 (“stranger first time”)].
  
  - $\rightarrow$ Put differently: Increase in validity

---

# Hypotheses

  - H3: There are statistically significant .cyan[differences] in trust-in-stranger measures .cyan[across different situations] (e.g., return a lost wallet, watch bags in an airport etc.). 
  
  - $\rightarrow$ situational character of trust 
  - $\rightarrow$ would allow computing cross-situational trust (i.e. average of the seven trust-in-stranger measures)
      
---

# Hypotheses
  
  - H4: The .cyan[number of associated topics] is .cyan[lower] for trust in “strangers” .cyan[when survey measures include a description of the situation]. 
  
  - $\rightarrow$ Increase in validity

  - $\rightarrow$ Justification of using more refined, explicit trust-in-stranger measures in future surveys!

---

# Summary and Discussion

- established measures of generalized trust are problematic (e.g., who are most people?”) and revisions are long overdue

- new situative trust measures that asks for specific strangers and specific matters (e.g. a total stranger in the airport scenario) $\rightarrow$ A trusts B to do X

- cross-situational trust as the average of trust assessments across different situations

- .cyan[Next step]: data collection (pre-test)
